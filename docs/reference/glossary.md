# Glossary

Key terms used throughout the Physical AI Book.

## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** - Computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning from examples and recognizing patterns.

**Algorithm** - A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation.

## B

**Binary** - A number system using only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers use binary at the hardware level.

## C

**Computational Complexity** - A measure of how much computational resources (time and memory) an algorithm requires.

**Concept** - A fundamental idea or principle that helps organize and understand information.

## D

**Data** - Raw information, often numerical or categorical, used as input to algorithms.

**Dataset** - A collection of data used for training, testing, or analysis.

## E

**Example** - A specific instance of applying a concept, used for learning or demonstration.

**Experiment** - Testing a hypothesis or trying variations to understand behavior.

## F

**Feedback Loop** - A process where output from one stage feeds into and influences the next stage.

**Function** - A reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times.

## G

**Graph** - A visual representation of data showing relationships and patterns.

## I

**Input** - Data provided to an algorithm or system as a starting point for processing.

**Iteration** - Repeating a process or calculation, typically with updated values or parameters.

## L

**Learning** - The process of acquiring knowledge or skills through experience or study.

**Logic** - A system of reasoning or the process of working through problems step-by-step.

## M

**Model** - A representation or abstraction of a real-world system or concept.

**Module** - A self-contained unit of code that performs a specific function.

## O

**Output** - The result or data produced by an algorithm or system after processing input.

**Optimization** - The process of improving efficiency, performance, or other desirable qualities.

## P

**Parameter** - A variable that controls or adjusts how a system or algorithm behaves.

**Pattern** - A repeated or recurring sequence, structure, or characteristic in data.

**Pipeline** - A sequence of processing steps where data flows from one step to the next.

**Process** - A series of actions or operations performed to achieve a goal.

## R

**Runtime** - The time period during which a program is executing or running.

## S

**Scaling** - Adjusting the size, magnitude, or proportion of something.

**Simulation** - A model or approximation of a real-world system used for testing or learning.

**State** - The current configuration or condition of a system at a particular point in time.

## T

**Test** - Executing code or a process with known inputs to verify it produces expected outputs.

**Transformation** - A change in form, structure, or characteristics of data or information.

## U

**Unit** - A single, indivisible element or component of a larger system.

## V

**Variable** - A named container that holds a value, which can change during program execution.

**Validation** - The process of checking that something is correct, accurate, or meets requirements.

## W

**Workflow** - The sequence of steps or processes followed to complete a task or project.
